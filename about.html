			<p><h1><strong>About</strong></h1></p>
			<p><h3>Web Monkeys is a Special Interest Group(SIG) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and we are affiliated with our ACM(Association for Computing Machinery) local chapter. We are, for the most part, like-minded students brought together by our common interest in all things related to web design and/or programming.</h3></p>
			
			<p><h3>Our main goal is to explore the new and emerging technologies of the web. From HTML5 to Python, from Rails to Node, we spend most of our time diving into projects whose sole purpose is to push the limits of the internet.</h3></p>

			<p><h3>Come join us is a few of our events to see what we’re up to. We will have many events throughout the year that you can stop by to say, “Hello!”</h3></p>
