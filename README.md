# WebMonkeys-Static-Site

This is the static website that is currently up (or will be up in the upcoming days) on WebMonkeys.

Feel free to play around with it on your own. 

If you have any suggestionbs for what you want to change on the wbesite, let me know during meetings and I'll see what I can do.

Happy Coding!
